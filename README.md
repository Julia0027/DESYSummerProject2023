# DESYSummerProject2023
JÃºlia Laguna- DESY Summer Internship project 2023: CTA monitoring arrays performance study. \
This project contains a folder with the code to obtain the IRFs from the Monte Carlo Simulations. The folder also includes some example  IRFs obtained with this code. \
The project also contains a folder with the code to plot and compare the IRFs  between different configurations stored in the first section.\
The third folder contains the code that takes the IRs from different configurations, simulates a variable source and obtains the light curves for the variable source that we expect we would obtain with each configurations, and then fits models to these obtained light curves and compares them between each other.\
As a remark, the code is written so that the notebooks from the second and third folder can access the IRFs obtained and stored in the first folder. To run this code on a local computer, the details on the paths that need to be changed are specified at the beginning of each notebook or .py file. \
In the fourth and last folder, there is the Summer Internship report with other analysis of the obtained results.
