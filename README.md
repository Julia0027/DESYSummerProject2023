# DESYSummerProject2023
JÃºlia Laguna- DESY Summer School project 2023.  <br>
This project aims to accomplish two goals:
- (Science verification) Study CTAO's expected performance at different construction stages.
- (Monitoring layouts) Monitoring of different variable sources using sub-arrays. <br>
<br>
This repository is organised in three folders.<br>
<br>
- The first folder, named IRFsobtention, contains the code to obtain the IRFs from the Monte Carlo Simulations results. At the beginning of the file the instructions are given, adressing how to run it and what to change depending on the sub-array configurations we want to test.<br>
- The second folder, called IRFsplots, contains the code to plot the IRFs and differential sensitivity (alongside the PPUT values) comparison between different configurations. At the beginning of the file we provide the instructions on how to run it, which is usually done using the IRFs obtained with the code from the first folder. 
- The third folder, named MLayouts, contains the code that takes the IRFs from different configurations and:
    - Simulates a variable source.
    - Extracts the light curves for the variable source and expected detection with the tested configurations.
    - Fits the expected detection data to regain the original spectra.
As a remark, the code is written so that the notebooks from the second and third folder can access the IRFs obtained and stored in the first folder.  <br>
The report resulting from this summer project, using the code provided in this repository, is also given in the pdf file on this folder. <br>
Thank you!
