# DESYSummerProject2023
JÃºlia Laguna- DESY Summer Internship project 2023: CTA monitoring arrays performance study.
This project contains a folder with the code to obtain the irf files from the Monte Carlo Simulations, alomgside some IRFs obtained via this method as an example. 
It also contains a folder with the code to plots and compare these obtained IRFs for different configurations.
The third folder contains the code that takes the IRF, simulates a variable source and obtains the light cuvres and fits models to these obtained light curves.
The code is written so that the notebooks from the second and third folder can access the IRFs obtained and stored in the first folder. 
In the fourth folder there are pdfs with the report and some preliminary results.
